𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: Meta/Facebook (Hard Level) hashtag#SQL Interview Question — Solution

A table named “famous” has two columns called user id and follower id. It represents each user ID has a particular follower ID. These follower IDs are also users of hashtag#Facebook / hashtag#Meta. Then, find the famous percentage of each user. 
Famous Percentage = number of followers a user has / total number of users on the platform.

🔍 At first glance, this might seem tedious, but it's straightforward once you break it down. Give it a try! 👇

𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐭:
CREATE TABLE famous (user_id INT, follower_id INT);

INSERT INTO famous VALUES
(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3), 
(11, 7), (12, 8), (13, 5), (13, 10), 
(14, 12), (14, 3), (15, 14), (15, 13);
-------------

𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐫𝐲:
1. distinct_users CTE:
Combines user_id and follower_id using UNION to get all unique users on the platform. This helps us determine the total number of users.

2. follower_count CTE:
Counts the number of followers for each user_id by grouping the rows in the famous table. This gives a list of users with their follower counts.

2. Final SELECT Statement:
Uses the data from follower_count and distinct_users to calculate the famous percentage for each user.

𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: Amazon (Hard Level) hashtag#SQL Interview Question — Solution

Given a table 'sf_transactions' of purchases by date, calculate the month-over-month percentage change in revenue. The output should include the year-month date (YYYY-MM) and percentage change, rounded to the 2nd decimal point, and sorted from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. The percentage change column will be populated from the 2nd month forward and calculated as ((this month’s revenue — last month’s revenue) / last month’s revenue)*100.

⏳ Dealing with dates in SQL is really important; mastering this skill gives you valuable exposure.Give it a try! 👇

I have provided an explanation and query, but I encourage you to try solving it first. Later, you can check the query for reference.

𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐫𝐲:
1. MonthlyRevenue CTE:
Aggregates the total revenue for each month using FORMAT to convert the created_at date to the format YYYY-MM.

2. RevenueChange CTE:
Adds a column previous_revenue using the LAG function, which fetches the total revenue of the previous month for each row.

3. Final SELECT:
Calculates the percentage change as ((total_revenue - previous_revenue) / previous_revenue) * 100. The ROUND function ensures the percentage is rounded to two decimal places. The output is ordered by year_month to display the data chronologically.
